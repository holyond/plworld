## main parts
1. world frame server
    save all data(world data, user data,world meta data)
    run swe
    exchange data in nodes
    manager all nodes
2. small world engine (swe)
3. node is basic unit, like a net game,there are server and client,plw is same,there are two kinds of node: plw client(wc) and plw server(ws)
4. but in my design,node wc and node ws are actually same ones,just the instance of same code,play diff roles,so client and server just logic concepts
